		<Hero name="">Honestly, I'm already completely confused...</Hero>
		<Hero name="">What happens in a dream, and what in reality?</Hero>
		<Hero name="">If we first met in a dream, then the evening walk was also a dream?</Hero>
		<Hero name="">But I donâ€™t remember how I got home in any other way, except with Ari</Hero>
		<Hero name="">Then, if the walk was in real life, then the first meeting was not a dream either?</Hero>
		<Hero name="">But how did I get home? We were at the bench. And then I don't remember anything.</Hero>
		<Hero name="">I should probably ask Ari about this.</Hero>
		<Hero name="">Although, then I'll have to admit that I have dreams with her, but I don't want that at all.</Hero>
		<Hero name="">Well...</Hero>
		<Hero name="">Okay, so for now we adhere to the theory that it was not a dream, otherwise this book would be part of mysticism.</Hero>
		<Hero name="">The name is so unusual... Divine Comedy.</Hero>
		<Hero name="">Maybe I'll read it someday.</Hero>
