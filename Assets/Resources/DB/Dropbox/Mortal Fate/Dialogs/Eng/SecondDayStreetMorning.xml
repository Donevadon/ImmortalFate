		<Hero name="">Dante Alighieri. The Divine Comedy. Interesting...</Hero>

		<Hero name="">How it was in it... Mmmm... But no, it's in another book. I didn't read this one because I had to work on the math once again.</Hero>

		<Hero name="">Instead of Dante, I read about complex numbers. Was it useful to me? Well, to pass the math exam, that's all.</Hero>
		<Hero name="">Although I don't know if the Divine Comedy would be useful to me. Maybe I would laugh once more</Hero>
