		<Hero name="Chris">Hey, have you ever heard of the déjà vu effect? Have you ever felt this way?</Hero>
		<Hero name="Security">No, this is the first time I hear about it. What's this?</Hero>
		<Hero name="Chris">In short, this is when a person feels that he has already been in a similar situation or in a similar place, said such things.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Security">Wow, I wonder... never experienced.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Security">...</Hero>
		<Hero name="Security">No, never.</Hero>

		<Hero name="">Oh huh, are they going to pity me?</Hero>
		<Hero name="">Let's go.</Hero>
		<Hero name="">Now for half an hour listening to "I'm sorry", "I sympathize" and "how is it, man, it's not fair" and the like.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Ari">Hey, hello!</Hero>
		<Hero name="Bob">Ed, where's your smile?</Hero>
		<Hero name="David">Okay, coming soon. We have good news for you.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed">I won't need to help anyone? Otherwise, I’ll probably refuse right away, I’ve already had enough, to be honest...</Hero>
		<Hero name="Ari">No, don't worry. We are just about this situation.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Bob">In short, it's good that you slept a little, otherwise it happened in the morning...</Hero>
		<Hero name="David">At first, when Bob and I entered the office, security and boss were discussing something, but I'm curious enough, and decided to overhear.</Hero>
		<Hero name="David">In general, we know that you hacked the locked door.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Bob">Yes, Mark came up and said that you didn't just break open the door, but also stole something.</Hero>
		<Hero name="David">We obviously did not believe it, because it seemed to us as strange as possible.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Bob">In short, to tell you the essence, listen.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Bob">We convinced the boss that Mark set you up.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Bob">It seems that this trap was not his goal, but the point is that you were in the "right place at the right time".</Hero>
		<Hero name="Bob">Well, your skills also played a role.</Hero>
		<Hero name="David">You won't get fired, Ed, you can relax.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Bob">Yes, that jerk Mark is fired. Hell, I never liked him.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Bob">Even his appearance is so... specific.</Hero>
		<Hero name="David">This is how villains usually look.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Bob">Yes, that's what I wanted to say.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed">So guys, wait a minute.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed">...</Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed">So, you mean, boss understood everything and just forgave me?</Hero>
		<Hero name="Ari">Yes, he got it. You didn't even know what was behind this door, and you yourself did not even open it.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed">I find it hard to believe so far...</Hero>
		<Hero name="David">Why? It's really not your fault, so relax.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed">And I'm also wondering why you decided to take care of this and help me?</Hero>
		<Hero name="Bob">What a stupid question, Ed?</Hero>
		<Hero name="David">Don't make us laugh, dude.</Hero>
		<Hero name="David">The answer is pretty simple. You helped us, and we helped you.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Bob">Besides, it literally cost us nothing, but you were so worn out helping us.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed">Not really, of course.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed">I find it hard to believe, too.</Hero>
		<Hero name="David">Dude, keep it simple, as if you never had friends and you can't believe this.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed">Well, strictly speaking, I really had not.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Ari">Now you have, Ed.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed">Yes, it's kind of strange, ahah.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed">Thank you guys.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed">Seriously, even if it didn't cost you anything. Thank you.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed">I wouldn't be here anymore if not for your help.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Bob">Really, never mind.</Hero>
		<Hero name="David">Dude, don't forget you still have a day plan. You're not fired, so get to work, ahaha.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Bob">Yeah, right... I totally forgot about that.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Bob">Well... Get to work!</Hero>

		<Hero name="">Unexpected, of course.</Hero>
		<Hero name="">This is all so strange.</Hero>
		<Hero name="">Really, as if I'm in a dream.</Hero>
		<Hero name="">Okay, I'll have time to think about it before bed. I have to work, since fate gives me such a chance.</Hero>
		<Hero name="">Maybe I jumped to conclusions about Ari's words last night. All the same, these guys really pulled me out of this situation.</Hero>
		<Hero name="">This is what it feels like...</Hero>

		<Hero name="Ari">Hey Ed, wake up.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed">What?</Hero>
		<Hero name="Ari">I say wake up, sleepyhead.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed">Am I dreaming? Where am I?</Hero>
		<Hero name="Ari">Aahha, you fell asleep at work, right on the table.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed">What? Seriously? What day is it?</Hero>
		<Hero name="Ari">Same as before you fell asleep.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed">...</Hero>
		<Hero name="Ari">Remember, no? You were almost fired today, but nothing happened.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed">God, I thought I was dreaming about that...</Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed">Damn, I'm already lost in dreams and reality.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed">By the way, yesterday I wanted to talk to you about this...</Hero>
		<Hero name="Ari">What about? About realities and dreams? You are so cute.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed">Yes, it's just a mismatch in my head.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Ari">Okay, let's talk now. Let's go, maybe, towards the house. The working day has already ended.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed">Already? So fast? I thought I only slept a few minutes.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Ari">I think it is. I was looking at you, you fell asleep very recently, so I think that's okay.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Ari"> Let's go out. The air is beautiful! </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed"> Beautiful? </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ari"> Yes! Have you ever noticed?</Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed"> Honestly, no </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed"> I haven't felt anything lately </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed"> Well lately ... For a very long time, actually </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed"> And I'm not just talking about the smell of this air </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed"> Everything seemed so gray, lifeless, tasteless and devoid of any odors to me </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed"> Probably since childhood. Ever since I can remember </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ari"> What happened in your childhood? </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed"> The fact of the matter is that nothing at all </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed"> Except for study and various prohibitions </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed"> And this, as you understand, is not a very pleasant thing </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed"> I didn't even have friends to feel what suddenly fell on me today </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed"> Fell, of course, not in a negative sense. Rather, it was unpredictable for me, I could not even imagine such a thing </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed"> It sound so pathetic ... </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ari"> No, it's not </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed"> I just now realized how immensely grateful I am for today </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ari"> Come on, this is what your loved ones are for </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed"> I've never experienced this </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ari"> Someday everything happens for the first time, Ed </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed"> Ari, you know, I have another strange and unfamiliar feeling right now </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed"> Feeling like my life is starting to change little by little </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed"> From tasteless to full of aromas </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed"> From gray to nicely colored </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed"> From lonely to filled with friendly emotions and quiet joy </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed"> I'm afraid now that I might accidentally drive this feeling away. </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed"> It's strange even to say it - before I had nothing to fear </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ari"> Don't be afraid, you won't drive these feelings away </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed"> Are you so sure? How do you know? </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ari"> I just believe it </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed"> Ari, thank you </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ari"> Why? </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed"> You played a big role in this. This story wouldn’t exist without you </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ari"> I'm very flattered if you really think so </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ari"> By the way, you wanted to talk about reality and dreams, remember? </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed"> Yes, of course </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed"> I wanted to say that I started to confuse what happens in a dream and what is in reality </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed"> Sometimes I am sure that the events that happened in reality were actually in my dreams </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed"> I wake up trying to solve a puzzle of events, but often it just doesn't work out </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed"> And now I am very interested, will it seem to me tomorrow morning that our current conversation was in my dream? </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed"> Tell me, is this a dream? </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ari"> No, this is real reality </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed"> It may sound very strange, but in recent days you appear in my dreams </Hero>
		<Hero name="Ari"> Oh Ed, I know that </Hero>

		<Hero name="Ed">That fateful day when I met Ari...</Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed">Five years have already passed, and I still clearly remember the evening after which my life began to change.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed">To be honest, I can't even believe that everything has changed so suddenly, because now I have friends, a new position at work and a wonderful girl with whom I want to connect my life.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed">All obsessive thoughts about death, that my life is useless disappeared.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed">I let go of the past and thanks to Ari I began to appreciate the present, to try for the future.</Hero>
		<Hero name="Ed">It's never too late to start living for real.</Hero>
